- Hi, I’m Shicong, an aspiring architect and data scientist. :house_with_garden:
- I'm currently learning to make use of data in the AEC industry to design, optimize and construct better and more sustainble built environment. :chart_with_upwards_trend:  
- Architecture has a lot of beauty with its meaningful use of space and material. I believe that we can make this process better by use of data. :seedling:
- I’m looking to collaborate on any ideas or projects you have about built environment and data. :sunglasses:
